# ECommerceBackend

This is an Ecommerce app I made with starter code. My work was with creating the sequalize database.
THis app uses Sequalize and Javascript

# User Story
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
